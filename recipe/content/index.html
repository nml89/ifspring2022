<h1>Honey Garlic Glazed Salmon</h1>
<h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>A delicious seafood meal that you're sure to never forget! The honey, soy sauce, and garlic perfectly compliment the salmon without
    taking over its natural flavor. This quick and easy meal takes about 20 minutes to make with 5 minutes of prep time. It is best served 
    with a white rice of your choice. A large skillet of any kind is the perfect pan for this dish.</p>
    
    <p><b>Remember to check for bones in your salmon before cooking!</b> To do this: cut your filets and run your fingers along the surface. If you feel any pricks or
    resistance, remove the bone using kitchen tweezers or your fingers.</p>

    <p class="allergen">This dish contains soy and fish.</p>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<p class="serving">(Serves four)</p>
<ol>
    <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
    <li>1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 tsp. red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>4 6-oz salmon filets, patted dry</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
    <li>Black pepper</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 lemon, sliced into rounds</li>

</ol>

<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the honey, soy sauce, lemon juice and red pepper flakes.</li>
    <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat two tablespoons of oil. When the oil is hot, but not smoking, add the salmon skin-side up and season with salt and pepper. Cook the salmon until it's deeply golden (about 6 minutes), flip over and add the remaining tablespoon of oil.</li>
    <li>Add garlic to the skillet and cook until fragrant (1 minute). Add the honey mixture and sliced lemons and cook until the sauce is reduced by about 1/3. Baste salmon with the sauce.</li>

<h2>Reference Recipe Websites:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>I like <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/">this</a> website because it makes use of space -- it has content everywhere.
    I immediately noticed the thin "Cookware" label between the article about the best cast-iron skillets. They have so many recipes that are easily accesible
    through the search bar. I love the way the articles are highlighed from behind when your mouse drags over it.  </li>
    <li><a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/">This</a> website is nice because it immediately shows you recipes for special occasions
    that you might be looking for (Valentine's Day, Superbowl, cold weather, etc.). While scrolling down the website, the "What's New" section is
    highlighted to show you everything you might have missed since your last time on the site. There's a large section for the newsletter at the bottom that is hard to miss, which I like.
    This website also has the same background-highlight when you hover your mouse over it as the first website I mentioned.</li>
    <li>I chose <a href="https://www.delish.com/"> this</a> website because I love the large imagery. It's the website I got my recipe from.
    Everything is very large, bright, and easy to read. My only criticism is that you must click on a sidebar to find the search bar; I'd find
    it easier if it was at the top-middle or top-right of the page.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Reference General Websites:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>I love <a href="https://www.abathhouse.com/"> this</a> website by Bathhouse Spa. I like the dark background and typewrite-style font -- it gives it an exclusive look.
    Though I like the vibe of the website, I don't care for the way its organized (in squares), which I find is very common with Squarespace sites.</li>
    <li><a href="https://forofficeuseonly.com/">This</a> website by For Office Use Only is beautifully designed. I really like how the projects take up the center of the page,
    while the brand name and information are still very visible off to the side. I love that feature of scrolling down and keeping the margins locked. It's simplistic,
    but you can tell that there was a lot of work put into it.</li>
    <li>I love how <a href="https://swabtheworld.com/en/">this</a> website by Swab the World uses color and animation. Everything looks very seamless.
    I also really like the color block that you see once entering the page, and how it leaves as you scroll down. I doubt I would be able to do something as complex
    as this right now, but it's definitely something to aim for. They have their two goals clearly at the top of the page, while the rest of the page
    shows the viewer facts. I really like everything about this website, from a design standpoint.</li>
